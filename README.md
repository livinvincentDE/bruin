🚀 **Week 5 of Data Engineering Zoomcamp by @DataTalksClub complete!**

Just finished **Module 5 – Data Platforms with Bruin** and explored how modern data platforms can be built using a single CLI tool.

### 📘 What I Learned

- ✅ Build end-to-end ELT pipelines with **Bruin**
- ✅ Configure environments and connections
- ✅ Use materialization strategies for incremental processing
- ✅ Add data quality checks to ensure data integrity
- ✅ Deploy pipelines from local to cloud (BigQuery)

Modern data platforms in a single CLI tool — no vendor lock-in.

Excited to continue building scalable, production-ready data workflows! 🚀
